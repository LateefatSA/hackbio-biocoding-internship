**Botany and Plant Science**

Have a look at this dataset. Some scientists are trying to engineer mutants for a crop to become resistant to a pesticide. They compared the metabolic response of the engineered mutants to the metabolic response of the wild type plants The took readings after 8 and 24 hours

**Task:**

Calculate the difference in metabolic response (ΔM) between the DMSO treatment from the 24 hours treatment for the wild type and mutants

Generate a scatter plot showing the difference for ΔM for WT and Mutants

Fit a line that satifies a y-intercept of 0 and a slope of 1.

Using a residual cut off of your choice (calculated a the difference between the fitted line and each point) calculate the residual of each point on the scatter plot

Color metabolites that fall within +/- n of your residual grey. For example, if you have a cut-off of 0.3, color residual values that are within -0.3 and +0.3 grey

Color metabolites that fall outside this range salmon.

What are these metabolites. How do you explain the trends you see on either direction of the plot?

Pick any 6 metabolites that fall outside this range and generate a line plot that spans from their 0h treatment to their 8h and 24hr. What can you say about the plots you see?
